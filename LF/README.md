# Formal Languages Theory Repository

## Introduction to Formal Languages Theory

This repository serves as a comprehensive guide to the theory of formal languages, covering fundamental concepts and structures. The material is organized based on Chomsky's hierarchy, exploring regular languages, context-free languages, and context-sensitive languages.

### 1. Introduction to the Theory of Formal Languages: Alphabets and Languages

This section provides a foundational understanding of formal languages, introducing the concepts of alphabets and languages.

### 2. Grammars and Chomsky Hierarchy

Delve into the hierarchy of Chomsky, exploring different types of grammars and their corresponding language classes.

### 3. Regular Languages

Explore the realm of regular languages, covering topics such as deterministic finite automata, nondeterministic finite automata, minimization of finite automata, regular expressions, and conversions between finite automata, regular expressions, and grammars. The Pumping Lemma is also discussed in this section.

### 4. Context-Free Languages

This section focuses on context-free languages, covering context-free grammars (CFG), simplifications of CFG, and normal forms. Additionally, it delves into the concept of pushdown automata and discusses conversions between context-free grammars and pushdown automata.

### 5. Context-Sensitive Languages

Explore languages that go beyond context-free, delving into context-sensitive grammars and the concept of a bounded tape in the form of a linear-bounded automaton.

## Usage

Each section of the repository is organized in a clear and structured manner, allowing users to navigate through different topics seamlessly. The materials include theoretical explanations, practical examples, and code implementations for a comprehensive learning experience.
