# Computer Architecture II Repository

This repository contains the projects developed by Thiago Porto and Mathaus Huber for the Computer Architecture II course. The projects cover various aspects of this discipline, including experiments, memory hierarchy, and virtual memory.

## Project 1 - Experiments in Computer Architecture II

### Description
In this project, the students conducted a series of experiments. The experiments were carried out using the Google Colab environment.

## Project 2 - Memory Hierarchy

### Description
This project explores memory hierarchy using an architecture based on an Intel i7 processor. Four cache levels (L1, L2, L3, and L4), along with main memory and mass storage, are considered.

### Hierarchy Configuration
- Processor: i7 2.93 GHz
- Number of Registers: 16 per processor core (4x16)
- Number of Hierarchy Levels: 4
- Number of Cache Levels: 4
- Addressing Mode: Byte
- Word Size: 32 bits
- Main Memory Size: 8GB
- Write Method: Write-Back

### Introduction
The work utilizes the Intel i7 CPU architecture with a modern view of memory hierarchy for energy efficiency and high performance. The SimpleScalar simulator and GCC-1 compiler benchmark were used for analysis.

## Project 3 - Virtual Memory and I/O

### Description
This project delves into the concepts of Virtual Memory and Input/Output (I/O). Virtual Memory is presented as a technique that offers security, efficient memory sharing, and allows the execution of programs larger than the main memory's capacity.
