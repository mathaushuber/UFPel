# Programming language concepts

## Research project

Analysis of programming languages for the resolution of the Gram-Schmidt process. Analyzes of the tools available in each of the test languages will be obtained, for the solution of the Gram-Schimdt process, in addition, the ease of
writing of the algorithm, time spent on error handling, and final result generated by the algorithm and comparison of the rounding errors.

## Practical Project

Study with Benchmark NPB in its serial form. Comparison of program performance using different options of GCC compiler optimization. In this work, a study of the effects of the optimizations of the GCC -O2 and -O3, was carried out.
comparing their effects on program execution in relation to execution time and missing cache memories. It was also used in the analysis of GCC data without these
optimizations with the -O0 flag (GCC default). The following kernels were used Benchmark NPB provided by NASA: IS, EP, CG, FT and MG. However, it was used a modified version where programs have only 1 thread (serial).
