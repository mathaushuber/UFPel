### Client-Server Architectures

This section includes exercises that demonstrate the implementation of basic client-server architectures. Examples showcase communication between a client and a server, handling multiple client connections, and basic data exchange.

### Chatroom

The chatroom project demonstrates a simple client-server chat application. Users can connect to a server and participate in real-time text communication. It serves as an introduction to building interactive applications over a network.

### Peer-to-Peer File Sharing

The peer-to-peer (P2P) file-sharing exercise explores a decentralized file-sharing network. Peers can share and download files directly from each other, demonstrating a simple P2P architecture.

### Simple P2P and Client-Server Exercises

This section includes various smaller exercises focusing on simple peer-to-peer interactions and client-server communication. These exercises cover different aspects of network programming.

### Books

The "Livros" (Books) folder contains the renowned textbook "Computer Networks" by Andrew S. Tanenbaum. This resource is a valuable reference for understanding computer network principles.

### Chess Game (External Repository)

For a more extensive project, check out the [chess-socket](https://github.com/HuberM1998/chess-socket) repository. This project implements a chess game using a client-server architecture. Feel free to explore and contribute to this chess game project.
