# Computer Architecture and Organization

Hardware/Software Interface. Machine language and mnemonic language. Instruction set and addressing modes. Organization of processors: operating block and control block. Performance Measures. Pipeline organization. RISC and CISC machines.

1. Introduction to computer architecture and organization: organization and architecture design of a hypothetical computer.
Registers, functional units, interconnection network, control unit, instruction format, instruction set,
addressing modes.
2. Programming in symbolic language: relationship between organization, architecture and programming. Subroutines and stacks. Exercises
programming in symbolic language.
3. RISC and CISC machines: main characteristics, example of RISC architecture: the reduced MIPS.
4. Organization of the reduced MIPS unicycle version: operating block components and their interconnection, timing scheme
(clock) and control block design.
5. Organization of MIPS reduced multicycle version: operating block components and their interconnection, timing scheme
(clock) and control block design. Comparison between the multicycle version and the unicycle version.
6. Organization of MIPS reduced pipeline version: introduction to pipeline design. Conflicts: types, examples and solutions. Block
pipeline operative. Forwarding capability and deviation prediction mechanisms. Comparison between the pipeline version, the
multicycle version and unicycle version.
7. Performance measures: definition of performance and key metrics.
