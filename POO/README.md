## Introduction

This repository serves as a comprehensive resource for learning and exploring Object-Oriented Programming concepts. It includes two main subdirectories: `EDL` for Data Structures and `Jogo` for a Warcraft-inspired game.

## EDL Subdirectory

### Data Structures

The `EDL` subdirectory focuses on Object-Oriented implementations of linear data structures. Here's a brief overview of what you'll find:

- **Queue:** Implementation of a queue data structure.
- **List:** Object-Oriented representation of a linked list.
- **Stack:** Object-oriented stack data structure.
- **Nodo:** A generic node class used in various data structures.

Feel free to explore each subdirectory to understand the principles and implementations of these data structures.

## Jogo Subdirectory

### Warcraft-Inspired Game

The `Jogo` subdirectory contains a Warcraft-inspired game. This section includes the source code and assets for the game. Dive into the directory to explore the implementation details and structure of the game. Whether you're a fan of Warcraft or just interested in game development with an Object-Oriented approach, this section has something for you.

## Usage

To explore the code and run the examples, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

```
git clone https://github.com/HuberM1998/UFPel/tree/master/POO
```

2. Navigate to the desired subdirectory (EDL or Jogo) and explore the codebase.

3. Run the examples or the game according to the provided instructions in each subdirectory.
