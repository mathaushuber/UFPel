# Computer Graphics Repository

Welcome to the Computer Graphics repository! This repository contains two main projects:

## 1. Space Invaders

The Space Invaders project is a web-based game developed using WebGL and computer graphics techniques. The game brings the classic Space Invaders experience to your browser, showcasing the capabilities of WebGL for creating interactive and visually appealing games.

### How to Run

To run the Space Invaders game, simply navigate to the 'space-invaders' folder and open the 'index.html' file in a WebGL-compatible web browser.

## 2. Mesh and Scene Editor

The Mesh and Scene Editor project is a WebGL-based application that serves as an editor for manipulating 3D meshes, scenes, and animations. This tool provides a user-friendly interface for creating and editing 3D content, demonstrating the power of computer graphics in interactive content creation.

### Features

- **Mesh Editing:** Modify and manipulate 3D meshes with ease.
- **Scene Composition:** Build and arrange scenes using a straightforward interface.
- **Animation Tools:** Create and preview animations for added interactivity.

### How to Run

To run the Mesh and Scene Editor, navigate to the 'Mesh-and-Scene' folder and open the 'mesh.html' and 'scene.html' file in a WebGL-compatible web browser.

## Requirements

Make sure your browser supports WebGL to experience these projects seamlessly.
