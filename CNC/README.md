## Project 3 - Polynomial Interpolation: Newton and Lagrange Forms

### Description
In this project, two algorithms for polynomial interpolation are implemented: Newton's Form and Lagrange's Form. Additionally, the implementation involves the use of the Newton form based on successive construction from lower-degree polynomials.

### Implementation Details

- Lagrange's Form Algorithm

### Advantages and Disadvantages
#### Lagrange's Form:
- **Advantages:**
  - Popular and well-known formula.
  - Easy to code.
  - No requirement for data to be specified in ascending or descending order.
  
- **Disadvantages:**
  - Inefficient for large values of n.
  - High-order polynomial interpolation is unstable.

#### Newton's Form:
- **Advantages:**
  - Similar advantages to Lagrange's Form.
  - Easy to code.

- **Disadvantages:**
  - Inefficiency for large values of n.
  - High-order polynomial interpolation is unstable.

## Project 4 - Least Squares Method

### Description
The fourth project delves into the Method of Least Squares (MLS), aiming to find the best fit for a set of data by minimizing the sum of the squares of the differences between the estimated and observed values.

### Implementation Details
- Modified Linear Approximation Algorithm

## Project 5 - Spline Functions

### Description
The last project involves implementing spline functions, where the approach is to approximate the tabulated function within each subinterval [xi, xi+1] using a polynomial of degree p.
