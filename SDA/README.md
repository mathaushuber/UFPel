# Advanced Digital Systems Repository

This repository contains implementations and projects related to advanced digital systems. The structure of the repository is organized into the following folders:

## HADAMARD

The HADAMARD folder contains the implementation of an architecture proposed by Jacques Hadamard. It features:
- Combinational and 2-stage design
- 16 samples per cycle

## MULTIPLICADORES

The MULTIPLICADORES folder focuses on VHDL implementations of 4-bit operand multipliers. It includes designs for both sequential and matrix multipliers.

## NEANDER

The NEANDER folder hosts a project for implementing a Neander architecture.

## TESTEBENCH_ULA

The TESTEBENCH_ULA folder includes test benches for the Arithmetic Logic Unit (ULA). This allows for comprehensive testing of the ULA's functionality.

## ULA_BANCO_REG

The ULA_BANCO_REG folder contains implementations related to the Arithmetic Logic Unit (ULA) and Register Bank.

Feel free to explore each folder for detailed information on the respective projects and implementations.
