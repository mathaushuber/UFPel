## Practical Project: Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) using Kruskal's Algorithm

In this practical project, you will be implementing Kruskal's algorithm to generate a Minimum Spanning Tree from a given graph. The corresponding files and documentation for this project are available in the designated folder.

## Theoretical Assignment: Types of Tries and Patricia Trees

Your theoretical assignment involves preparing a detailed report on different types of tries, with a special emphasis on Patricia trees. Dive into the theoretical aspects, applications, and advantages of these tree structures. Your report should include insights into how Patricia trees can be applied to various problems and scenarios.
