# Karloff Compiler Repository

Welcome to the Karloff Compiler Repository! This repository is dedicated to the development of a compiler for the Karloff programming language. The project is organized into several sub-folders, each addressing specific aspects of the compiler's implementation.

## Sub-folders

### 1. Compilador

The `Compilador` folder represents the initial phase of the Karloff compiler, providing a basic implementation.

### 2. CompiladorFinal

The `CompiladorFinal` folder marks the completion of all phases of the Karloff compiler. This includes lexical analysis, syntax analysis, and other essential components.

### 3. Interpretador

The `Interpretador` folder focuses on the implementation of an interpreter for the Karloff programming language. This provides an alternative approach to executing Karloff programs without compiling them.

### 4. Karloff_Lexico

The `Karloff_Lexico` folder is dedicated to the lexical analysis phase of the Karloff compiler. It includes the implementation of the lexical analyzer for the Karloff language.

### 5. Karloff_Sintatico

The `Karloff_Sintatico` folder addresses the syntactic analysis phase of the Karloff compiler. It includes the implementation of the syntax analyzer for the Karloff language.
