## Introduction

In this repository, we delve into the world of system programming with a focus on implementing the z808 hypothetical machine. The content covers various aspects of system programming, including source languages, language translation, and the mechanisms involved.

### Topics Covered:

- Source languages, translation of programming languages, and their mechanisms.
- Types of translators.
- Key functions of translators and generalities about their implementations.

## Mnemonic Languages and Assembler Construction

This section explores mnemonic languages and the construction of assemblers for the z808 hypothetical machine.

### Topics Covered:

- Characteristics of mnemonic languages or assembly languages.
- Examples of programming in mnemonic language.
- Single-pass and two-pass assemblers.
- Main functions of an assembler.
- Implementation of an assembler for the z808 hypothetical machine.

## Macro Processor

The focus shifts to macro processors, considering subprograms and macros. Concepts, comparisons, libraries, macro definition and expansion, parameters, and syntactic markers are explored.

### Topics Covered:

- Usage examples of macros in mnemonic language (macro assembler).
- Single-pass and two-pass macro processors.
- Nested definitions and nested calls.
- Implementation of a macro preprocessor for the z808 hypothetical machine.

## Linkers and Loaders

The final section deals with linkers and loaders, providing insights into compilation-to-execution functions such as address relocation, module linking, library handling, memory allocation, and program loading.

### Topics Covered:

- Loader types and functions.
- Linker types, functions, associated symbol tables, and transfer vectors.
- Implementation of a linker and loader for the z808 hypothetical machine.
