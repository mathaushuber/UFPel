# Algorithms and Data Structures III Repository

Welcome to the Algorithms and Data Structures III Repository! This repository focuses on solving the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) using both exact brute force algorithms and heuristic methods. Explore the implementation, compare the results, and gain insights into the challenges and advantages of each approach.

## Course Overview
